The God of War series revolves around Kratos, a Spartan warrior seeking revenge against the gods of Olympus.
 In the original trilogy, Kratos rises to power, but his thirst for vengeance leads to destructive consequences. 
 After the events of the original trilogy, the 2018 installment, also titled "God of War," shifts its focus to Norse mythology.
 Kratos, now living in Midgard, attempts to start anew and build a relationship with his son, Atreus. The duo embarks on a journey 
 to fulfill the last wishes of Kratos' deceased wife by scattering her ashes from the highest peak in the Nine Realms. The game
combines brutal combat, puzzle-solving, and a compelling narrative, exploring themes of fatherhood, redemption, and the consequences
 of one's past actions. The 2018 God of War installment received widespread acclaim for its storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and a 
 more mature and nuanced portrayal of its protagonist.
